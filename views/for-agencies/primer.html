    <h1 class="page-title">Primer on Interagency Agreements</h1>
    <p class="synopsis">18F relies upon a legal device known as Interagency Agreements (<abbr title="Interagency Agreement">IAA</abbr>s) to work with other government agencies. This document outlines what you need to know&mdash;and, more importantly, what you need to do&mdash;to help us draft an agreement that works for everyone.</p>
    <p><abbr title="Interagency Agreement">IAA</abbr>s are comprised of two documents: a set of General Terms and Conditions and one or more Order Requirements and Funding Information <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-forms" id="footnote-forms-ref">documents</a>. The General Terms and Conditions provide a broad outline of the nature of the relationship between our <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-agreement-period" id="footnote-agreement-period-ref">agencies</a>. Each <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-order-requirements-and-funding-information" id="footnote-order-requirements-and-funding-information-ref">Order Requirements and Funding Information document</a> details a specific project&rsquo;s <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-statement-of-work" id="footnote-statement-of-work-ref">statement of work</a>, proposed cost, and period of performance. While there&rsquo;s only one set of General Terms and Conditions per <abbr title="Interagency Agreement">IAA</abbr>, there may be multiple Order Requirements and Funding Information documents for different projects or performance periods.</p>

        <p><abbr title="Interagency Agreement">IAA</abbr>s are comprised of two documents: a set of General Terms and Conditions and one or more Order Requirements and Funding Information document unique to each <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-figure-1" id="footnote-figure-1-ref">project</a>.</p>
      </figcaption>

    <p><abbr title="Interagency Agreement">IAA</abbr>s only <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-obligate-funds" id="footnote-obligate-funds-ref">obligate funds</a> when your agency issues its first order requirements document. Obligated funds are transferred to 18F as payment when we invoice for services or products we&rsquo;ve delivered. If a project comes in under budget, these funds may be deobligated by your finance office and used for other <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-cost-recovery" id="footnote-cost-recovery-ref">purposes</a>.</p> 
    <p>Every agency has different policies on who can sign an <abbr title="Interagency Agreement">IAA</abbr>. Generally, signing an <abbr title="Interagency Agreement">IAA</abbr> requires signatures from both a program official (with authority to sign the agreement) and a representative of the chief financial officer (with authority to sign the agreement and obligate the necessary funds). Please check with your agency&rsquo;s Office of the Chief Financial Officer to find out who can sign these documents.</p>
    <p>Finally, due to the way that 18F <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-authority" id="footnote-authority-ref">executes</a> its <abbr title="Interagency Agreement">IAA</abbr>s, we also require a Determination and Findings statement including three provisions: that the <abbr title="Interagency Agreement">IAA</abbr> is in the best interest of the government, that the product or services cannot be obtained conveniently or economically by contracting with a private source, and that 18F has the capability or expertise to provide services not available within your own agency. Depending on your agency&rsquo;s policy, the Determination and Findings statement may require the signature of the program official responsible for this agreement or a contracting officer. Please check with your Office of the Chief Financial Officer to determine who can sign. If the agreement is for an assisted acquisition, a contracting officer&rsquo;s signature is <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-far" id="footnote-far-ref">required</a>.</p>
    <h1>What we&rsquo;ll need from you</h1>
    <p>Completing the <abbr title="Interagency Agreement">IAA</abbr> process usually takes about four weeks. Much of that time is spent creating a mutually agreeable statement of work. <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-hard-at-work" id="footnote-hard-at-work-ref">18F initiates</a> this process by drafting a statement of work and sharing it with you for comment. </p>
    <p>Once the statement of work is agreed upon, we&rsquo;ll require a few additional pieces of information, including contact information for your program official (the person from your agency with the authority to sign the <abbr title="Interagency Agreement">IAA</abbr>) and your funding official (the person from your agency with the authority to obligate the funds needed for the <abbr title="Interagency Agreement">IAA</abbr>) as well as information about the type of money you&rsquo;ll use to pay 18F (for example, &ldquo;one-year,&rdquo; &ldquo;multi-year,&rdquo; or &ldquo;no-year&rdquo;) and financial codes from your finance office. We&rsquo;ll send you a form to collect this information. </p>

    <p>We are happy to help with the <abbr title="Interagency Agreement">IAA</abbr> process&mdash;we&rsquo;re just as excited to start working together as you are! Feel free to contact Acquisitions and Agreements Lead Joshua Bailes anytime.</p>

          <p>18F uses two forms for these components: (1) Treasury form 7600A for the General
          Terms and Conditions; and (2) Treasury form 7600B for the Order Requirements and
          Funding Information. See <a href=

          <p>It&rsquo;s easiest to think of the Order Requirements and Funding Information
          document as a task or work order submitted to a vendor. The Period of Performance
          is set on Form 7600B (Order Requirements and Funding Information). This period is
          specific to a particular project and obligates both parties: 18F to perform the
          tasks in a period of time, and your agency to pay the actual costs incurred by 18F
          during that period of performance.</p><a href=
